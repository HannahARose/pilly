please see the documentation for the language [here](https://github.com/Horizon-Labs/pilly/wiki) if you have any questions on the language

## Disclaimer:
This was based off of a tutorial on writing a programming language in js, the extent of my originality is limited to implementing the tutorial in java and maybe a few functions. I would link the tutorial, but this was written a few years ago and I have lost the page. (if you recognize this and think you know the original tutorial, please contact me so I can give credit)
